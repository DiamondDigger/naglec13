About my < <b>soft skills</b> > - I worked in different areas on positions "electrician for maintenance of hoisting mechanisms and cranes", "duty engineer (dispatcher) of a power electrical substation" and some others =)
  - you work when someone broke something - you should analyzing all conditions find and fix the problem in the shortest period of times
  - working with people - you should prepare safe conditions for your team in a dangerous area - responsibility for your decisions and lives of others
- stick to a big number of rules and documentation - clear understanding and following the set of rules
- ability to find collaborative decisions and negotiate in difficult situations
- work as a team
- work under the pressure
- share cakes and goodies with teammates
